audio annotation for webvr
I am running Glossy on an aws instance, using mongo for the database. I am using recorderjs, webvr boilerplate, websockets, and web audio.
To run the program in an HTC vive, it's necessary to use a version of Chromium that supports webvr. 
To use web audio, you'll need to use an https address (instead of http). 

Front end code is in index.html, and server code is in index.js. 
Currently has a lot of vestigial files, cleanup incoming :)
